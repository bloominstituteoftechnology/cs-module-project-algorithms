## Runtime complexities:
`O(1)`: constant time
```py
# adding to / removing keys from dictionaries
# 1:1 element comparison
```
`O(n)`: linear time
```py
# Dependent on length/size of array/iterable
# Single loop
```
`O(log n)`: logarithmic time
```py
# Binary search
# Halving as you go
```
`O(n^2)`: quadratic time 
```py
# nested loops
for x in this: # O(n)
    for y in that: # O(n)
        return x, y
```
