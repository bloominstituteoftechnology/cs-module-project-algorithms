'''
The idea is that we have a backpack with
a size or weight limit that constrains
how many things we can put inside.
â€‹
We have lots of items we want to put into
the knapsack. However, they won't all fit.
Choosing the optimal combination of items
that meets size or weight constraints while
maximizing value might seem doable with a
small example, but this becomes a difficult
problem very quickly.
