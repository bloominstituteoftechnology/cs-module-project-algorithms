# Module Project - Algorithms

* Effectively ask for help by giving the expected vs. experienced behavior, explaining what specific actions they've taken so far, and providing all relevant information and code
* Interpret a problem, specification, or diagram and construct a plan for implementing a solution in code
* Implement a first-pass solution after selecting from a na√Øve, brute-force, or greedy approach

## Introduction

This module project requires you to practice each of the learning objectives by synthesizing them to solve the included challenges. For Module 3, you will complete a first-pass solution for each of the problems. Then, in Module 4, you will improve your previous solution by applying the techniques you learned during pre-instruction and the Guided Project.

These types of algorithmic challenges simulate many of the problems that you might receive during a job interview. They require you to practice using all of your data structures knowledge, problem-solving capabilities, and algorithmic practice that you've done thus far. The more practice you get at applying these skills, the more likely you are to do well under pressure in a job interview setting. Additionally, this practice deepens your understanding through application.

## Instructions and/or Completion Requirements
### A First-Pass Solution

A subjective ranking of the given problems from easiest to hardest might go something like this:

 1. `single_number`
 2. `moving_zeroes`
 3. `product_of_all_other_numbers`
 4. `sliding_window_max`
 5. `eating_cookies`

Module 3: First-pass solution
Module 4: Optimize them for performance

### Writing Better Solutions

For the Module 4 project, your main objective is to work on improving at least two of your first-pass solutions from Module 3. In particular, for one of your first-pass solutions, assess the runtime and space complexity of the implementation, think about why it's inefficient and how it could be improved, then implement the improved solution. 

## Stretch goals

You will follow the same process as above for each of these **stretch problems**. Make sure you complete the requirements for this module project, before moving on to the stretch problems.

1. `rock_paper_scissors`
2. `making_change`
3. `knapsack`
